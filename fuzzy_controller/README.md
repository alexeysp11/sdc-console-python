# The Fuzzy Controller module
The Fuzzy Controller module is used for counting speed of a car according to the distance between it and next and previous 
points on the map. 
## Overview
In this program we need to pass a value of distance to the input of the fuzzy controller and get a value of speed as an output. 
## Plots
Plots are used for only university reports to show that this algorithm is working correctly but in 2D simulation we are not going to use 
them.
