The Fuzzy Controller module

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6th of August, 2020. 

I don't how to to test the Fuzzy Controller Module.

In fuzzy_controller.py we declaired the class named Fuzzy Controller that we can use both for 
the control system simulation and for reports. 
This class has __init__ and count_speed methods. 

In fuzzy_controller_for_report.py we import this class and test it in plotting the linguistic 
variables and the relationship between distance and speed, and getting discrete values of the 
variables. 

In fuzzy_controller_for_report.py we can try to use inharitance pattern, try/catch etc. 

I guess that fuzzy controller can be connected to MPC.
