# RTLS 
Here I implement and test different models of **Kalman filter**. 
## Sensors 
This module should simulate sensor observations of the values that has been generated in *env* module. 
## Predictive models
I'm going to use simple **Kalman filter** model that can change value of *process variance* depending on that how large *aposteri error* is.
