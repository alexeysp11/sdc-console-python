# RTLS with Kalman Filter
Here I implement and test different models of Kalman filter. 
## Environment 
In this module I implement models that generate truth position, velocity and angle of rotation. 
## Sensors 
This module should generate observations of the values that has been generated in environment 
module. 
## Predictive models
I'm going to use simple Kalman filter model that can change value of process variance 
depending on that how large aposteri error is.
