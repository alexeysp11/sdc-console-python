"""
This model should predict position of a car depending on data 
from sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, speedometer etc)
relying on physical models (s = vt, v = at etc) to reduce an error 
of KF predictions. 

Estimations from this file should be passed to another file that can 
help us to estimate truth position relying on kf estimations and 
formula estimations.
